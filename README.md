To generate a 100 kHz PWM signal on PB0 and PB1 using the HC908QT2 microcontroller in C, you need to configure the timer module to generate PWM signals. The HC908QT2 microcontroller has a Timer Interface Module (TIM) that can be used for PWM generation.


## main.c
Here’s a basic example of how you can set up the PWM output on PB0 and PB1:

### 1. Include the necessary header files
```c
#include <hc908qt2.h>  // Include the header file for HC908QT2
```

### 2. Configure the TIM for PWM generation
```c
void PWM_Init(void) {
    // Set PB0 and PB1 as output for PWM
    DDRB |= (1 << PB0) | (1 << PB1);

    // Configure TIM for PWM mode
    TSC = 0x00;          // Stop the timer
    TMOD = 0x02;         // Set TIM in PWM mode (8-bit PWM)
    TSC_TOIE = 0;        // Disable Timer Overflow Interrupt
    TSC = 0x0C;          // Enable Timer and set prescaler to 1 (no prescaling)

    // Set the PWM frequency to 100 kHz
    // Assuming the bus clock is 8 MHz, the period for 100 kHz is 80 cycles
    // Since we are using 8-bit PWM, the period is 256 cycles
    // To get 100 kHz, we need to adjust the bus clock or use a different prescaler
    // For simplicity, let's assume the bus clock is 8 MHz and we use a prescaler of 1
    // The PWM frequency is then Bus Clock / (Prescaler * 256) = 8 MHz / 256 = 31.25 kHz
    // To achieve 100 kHz, we need to adjust the bus clock or use a different approach

    // For 100 kHz, we need a period of 10 µs
    // If the bus clock is 8 MHz, then 8 cycles = 1 µs
    // So, 80 cycles = 10 µs
    // We can use a 16-bit PWM mode or adjust the bus clock

    // For simplicity, let's assume we are using a 16-bit PWM mode
    // Set the period to 80 cycles
    TMODH = 0x00;        // High byte of the period
    TMODL = 0x50;        // Low byte of the period (80 in decimal)

    // Set the duty cycle for PB0 and PB1
    // For 50% duty cycle, set the compare value to half of the period
    TCH0H = 0x00;        // High byte of the compare value for PB0
    TCH0L = 0x28;        // Low byte of the compare value for PB0 (40 in decimal)
    TCH1H = 0x00;        // High byte of the compare value for PB1
    TCH1L = 0x28;        // Low byte of the compare value for PB1 (40 in decimal)

    // Enable PWM output on PB0 and PB1
    TSC |= (1 << TSC_TOIE);  // Enable Timer Overflow Interrupt (if needed)
}
```

### 3. Main function
```c
void main(void) {
    PWM_Init();  // Initialize PWM

    while (1) {
        // Main loop
        // You can adjust the duty cycle dynamically if needed
    }
}
```

### 4. Explanation
- **DDRB**: Data Direction Register for Port B. Setting a bit to 1 configures the corresponding pin as an output.
- **TSC**: Timer Status and Control Register. Used to control the timer module.
- **TMOD**: Timer Modulo Register. Sets the period of the PWM signal.
- **TCH0H/TCH0L**: Timer Compare High/Low Registers for channel 0 (PB0). Sets the duty cycle for PB0.
- **TCH1H/TCH1L**: Timer Compare High/Low Registers for channel 1 (PB1). Sets the duty cycle for PB1.

### 5. Notes
- The example assumes a bus clock of 8 MHz. If your bus clock is different, you will need to adjust the prescaler and period values accordingly.
- The example sets a 50% duty cycle. You can adjust the duty cycle by changing the values in `TCH0L` and `TCH1L`.
- The HC908QT2 microcontroller may have specific registers and bit configurations. Refer to the datasheet for detailed information.

### 6. Additional Considerations
- If you need a precise 100 kHz PWM signal, you may need to adjust the bus clock frequency or use a different prescaler value.
- Ensure that the TIM module is correctly configured for PWM mode and that the output pins are correctly set up.

This code provides a basic framework for generating PWM signals on PB0 and PB1. You may need to fine-tune the settings based on your specific requirements and the clock configuration of your microcontroller.



## Makefile
Below is the **complete `Makefile`** for compiling, linking, and generating the HEX file for the HC908QT2 microcontroller using **SDCC-M08**. This Makefile is tailored for the PWM program provided earlier and includes all necessary steps for building the project.

### Complete Makefile for SDCC-M08
```makefile
# Makefile for HC908QT2 PWM program using SDCC-M08

# Target microcontroller
TARGET = m08

# Output file names
OUTPUT = pwm_output
HEX = $(OUTPUT).hex
REL = $(OUTPUT).rel

# Source files
SRC = main.c

# Compiler and flags
CC = sdcc
CFLAGS = -m$(TARGET) --std-sdcc11 --opt-code-size
LDFLAGS = -m$(TARGET) --out-fmt-ihx

# Default target
all: $(HEX)

# Compile the source code into a relocatable object file
$(REL): $(SRC)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# Link the object file into a HEX file
$(HEX): $(REL)
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

# Clean up build files
clean:
	rm -f *.asm *.lst *.mem *.map *.lk *.rel *.rst *.sym *.ihx *.hex *.adb *.cdb

# Flash the HEX file to the microcontroller (replace with your programmer command)
flash:
	programmer-cli -f $(HEX)  # Replace with your actual flashing command

# Phony targets
.PHONY: all clean flash
```

### Explanation of the Makefile:

1. **Variables**:
   - `TARGET`: Specifies the target microcontroller (`m08` for HC08 family).
   - `OUTPUT`: The base name for the output files.
   - `SRC`: The source file (`main.c` in this case).

2. **Compiler and Flags**:
   - `CC`: The compiler to use (`sdcc`).
   - `CFLAGS`: Compiler flags:
     - `-m$(TARGET)`: Specifies the target microcontroller.
     - `--std-sdcc11`: Enables C11 standard compliance.
     - `--opt-code-size`: Optimizes for code size.
   - `LDFLAGS`: Linker flags:
     - `-m$(TARGET)`: Specifies the target microcontroller.
     - `--out-fmt-ihx`: Outputs the file in Intel HEX format.

3. **Targets**:
   - `all`: The default target, which builds the HEX file.
   - `$(REL)`: Compiles the source code into a relocatable object file.
   - `$(HEX)`: Links the object file into a HEX file.
   - `clean`: Removes all generated files.
   - `flash`: A placeholder for flashing the HEX file to the microcontroller. Replace the `programmer-cli` command with the actual command for your programmer.

4. **Phony Targets**:
   - `.PHONY`: Specifies targets that are not actual files (e.g., `all`, `clean`, `flash`).

### Directory Structure:
Ensure your project directory looks like this:
```
project/
├── main.c       # Your C source file
├── Makefile     # The Makefile provided above
```

---

### Usage:

1. **Build the Project**:
   Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will generate the `pwm_output.hex` file.

2. **Clean the Build**:
   To remove all generated files, run:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

3. **Flash the HEX File**:
   Replace the `programmer-cli` command in the `flash` target with the actual command for your programmer. For example, if you're using a specific programming tool, you might use:
   ```bash
   make flash
   ```

---

### Example Flashing Command:
If you're using a tool like `P&E Micro` for flashing, the `flash` target might look like this:
```makefile
flash:
	peprogrammer -f $(HEX)
```

If you're using a different tool, replace `peprogrammer` with the appropriate command.

---

### Notes:
- Ensure that SDCC is installed and properly configured for the HC08 target (`sdcc-m08`).
- Refer to the SDCC documentation for additional compiler and linker options: [SDCC Documentation](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/).
- If your programmer uses a different command-line interface, update the `flash` target accordingly.

This `Makefile` is complete and ready to use with your HC908QT2 PWM program. Let me know if you need further assistance!
