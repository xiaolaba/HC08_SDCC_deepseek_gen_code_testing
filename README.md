To generate a 100 kHz PWM signal on PB0 and PB1 using the HC908QT2 microcontroller in C, you need to configure the timer module to generate PWM signals. The HC908QT2 microcontroller has a Timer Interface Module (TIM) that can be used for PWM generation.

Here’s a basic example of how you can set up the PWM output on PB0 and PB1:

### 1. Include the necessary header files
```c
#include <hc908qt2.h>  // Include the header file for HC908QT2
```

### 2. Configure the TIM for PWM generation
```c
void PWM_Init(void) {
    // Set PB0 and PB1 as output for PWM
    DDRB |= (1 << PB0) | (1 << PB1);

    // Configure TIM for PWM mode
    TSC = 0x00;          // Stop the timer
    TMOD = 0x02;         // Set TIM in PWM mode (8-bit PWM)
    TSC_TOIE = 0;        // Disable Timer Overflow Interrupt
    TSC = 0x0C;          // Enable Timer and set prescaler to 1 (no prescaling)

    // Set the PWM frequency to 100 kHz
    // Assuming the bus clock is 8 MHz, the period for 100 kHz is 80 cycles
    // Since we are using 8-bit PWM, the period is 256 cycles
    // To get 100 kHz, we need to adjust the bus clock or use a different prescaler
    // For simplicity, let's assume the bus clock is 8 MHz and we use a prescaler of 1
    // The PWM frequency is then Bus Clock / (Prescaler * 256) = 8 MHz / 256 = 31.25 kHz
    // To achieve 100 kHz, we need to adjust the bus clock or use a different approach

    // For 100 kHz, we need a period of 10 µs
    // If the bus clock is 8 MHz, then 8 cycles = 1 µs
    // So, 80 cycles = 10 µs
    // We can use a 16-bit PWM mode or adjust the bus clock

    // For simplicity, let's assume we are using a 16-bit PWM mode
    // Set the period to 80 cycles
    TMODH = 0x00;        // High byte of the period
    TMODL = 0x50;        // Low byte of the period (80 in decimal)

    // Set the duty cycle for PB0 and PB1
    // For 50% duty cycle, set the compare value to half of the period
    TCH0H = 0x00;        // High byte of the compare value for PB0
    TCH0L = 0x28;        // Low byte of the compare value for PB0 (40 in decimal)
    TCH1H = 0x00;        // High byte of the compare value for PB1
    TCH1L = 0x28;        // Low byte of the compare value for PB1 (40 in decimal)

    // Enable PWM output on PB0 and PB1
    TSC |= (1 << TSC_TOIE);  // Enable Timer Overflow Interrupt (if needed)
}
```

### 3. Main function
```c
void main(void) {
    PWM_Init();  // Initialize PWM

    while (1) {
        // Main loop
        // You can adjust the duty cycle dynamically if needed
    }
}
```

### 4. Explanation
- **DDRB**: Data Direction Register for Port B. Setting a bit to 1 configures the corresponding pin as an output.
- **TSC**: Timer Status and Control Register. Used to control the timer module.
- **TMOD**: Timer Modulo Register. Sets the period of the PWM signal.
- **TCH0H/TCH0L**: Timer Compare High/Low Registers for channel 0 (PB0). Sets the duty cycle for PB0.
- **TCH1H/TCH1L**: Timer Compare High/Low Registers for channel 1 (PB1). Sets the duty cycle for PB1.

### 5. Notes
- The example assumes a bus clock of 8 MHz. If your bus clock is different, you will need to adjust the prescaler and period values accordingly.
- The example sets a 50% duty cycle. You can adjust the duty cycle by changing the values in `TCH0L` and `TCH1L`.
- The HC908QT2 microcontroller may have specific registers and bit configurations. Refer to the datasheet for detailed information.

### 6. Additional Considerations
- If you need a precise 100 kHz PWM signal, you may need to adjust the bus clock frequency or use a different prescaler value.
- Ensure that the TIM module is correctly configured for PWM mode and that the output pins are correctly set up.

This code provides a basic framework for generating PWM signals on PB0 and PB1. You may need to fine-tune the settings based on your specific requirements and the clock configuration of your microcontroller.
